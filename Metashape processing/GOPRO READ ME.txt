EcoRRAP Metashape processing: DSLR 

The current scripts are used in the EcoRRAP workflow for producing 2D and 3D models using Agisoft Metashape from DSLR imagery (see SOP: https://aimsgovau.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/RRAPEcoRRAP/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE9F3BBC5-893D-4579-AF69-BD3837B62B8F%7D&file=3D%20Processing%20Cheat%20Sheet_20230313.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)  
At the time of writing, the Metashape version in-use is 1.8.0, and as such, instructions are reflective of this. 
Future versions of Metashape may require revision of python scripts to ensure continued fucntionality and efficiecy. 
An annual review of these scripts and the associated SOP will be conducted during the life of the sub-program.  

EcoRRAP processing scripts are split into three:
- Chain 1
	Requires: Metashape project saved and all photos imported (one chunk per project)
	Processing location: Local, designed for use in field
	Contains jobs: Photo quality check, photo disable, lowest quality alignment, marker detection, add and check scale bars, import marker depth, generate processing log, save file

- Chain 2 - Part 1
	Requires: Metashape project processed to completion of Chain 1 and error checked
	Processing location: Network or Local, Network ideal
	Contains jobs: High quality alignment, calculate scalebar error, resize bouding box, duplicate chunk, save file

- Manual step
	Requires: Manual intervention in bounding box placement and quality control check (described below)

- Chain 2 - Part 2
	Requires: Metashape project processed to completion of Chain 2 Part 1 and manual quality control check
	Processing location: Network or Local, Network ideal
	Contains jobs: Crop point cloud, initial camera optimization, filer and re-optimization of cameras, build depth maps, build mesh, build texture

Instructions

Chain 1 

If first time using script:
-Navigate to script ‘Chain 1’ and right click to open in IDLE or alternative viewer 
-Read lines 1-57 of script to understand functionality, required user inputs, and default values used 

Before running script: 
-Confirm default settings within the script (keep default unless required) 
-scalebarpath = 'C:/scripts/EcoRRAP/scalebars.txt'  
-The default is the recommended file location on the local drive  
tolerance_firstattempt = 25 (marker tolerance) 
tolerance_secondattempt = 50 (marker tolerance if < 3 scalebars) 
min_marker_projections = 5 (disables markers with projections < value) 
marker_projection_error_threshold = 50 (removes marker projections from photos where error is > value) 


Chain 2 - Part 1 

If first time using script:
- Determine whether to run script on the Network (default) or Locally (on your personal computer. Routine processing should take place on the Network. 
- Navigate to script ‘Chain 2 Part 1 Network/Local’ and right click to open in IDLE or alternative viewer 
- Read lines 1-16 of script to understand functionality 
- No user input is required  


Manual step: A manual step is then required (described below) before running the next script

-Visually check bounding box placement and edit as required:
--Check that the plot is located in the centre of the bounding box. Refer to sphere trees as visual markers of plot location (Fig. 2a-d). 
--If the bounding box needs to be moved or rotated use the ‘Move bounding box’ and ‘Rotate bounding box’ tools (Fig. 2e,f). 
--Ensure to re-select the arrow tool once bounding box adjustment complete 
--Navigate to Workflow > Build Mesh, and select Sparse Cloud as the source (all other options as default) to re-make the mesh to check adjusted bounding box placement  
--Repeat process if required 
--Note: This step is best completed on remote connection to desktop computers (e.g. AIMS-CT73NF3) not the network server due to graphics loading time and lag. 


Chain 2 - Part 2

If first time using script:
-Determine whether to run script on the Network (default) or Locally (on your personal computer. Routine processing should take place on the Network. 
-Navigate to script ‘Chain 2 Part 2 Network/Local’ and right click to open in IDLE or alternative viewer 
-Read lines 1-16 of script to understand functionality 
-No user input is required  


Metashape processing is now complete and models should be checked for quality
