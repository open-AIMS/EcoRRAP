Ecological Intelligence for Reef Restoration (EcoRRAP)


The EcoRRAP R&D Subprogram fills key knowledge gaps essential for the success and cost-effectiveness of reef restoration interventions.
An integrated field program, EcoRRAP provides data on region-, temperature- and species-specific coral life-histories.
It quantifies natural rates of recovery and adaptation in response to global and local changes, as well as rates of recovery in response to interventions.
The central objective is to optimise interventions by understanding the ‘how, where, and when’ of natural reef recovery. 
This foundational data will help inform assumptions and decisions across the whole of RRAP and enable the success and cost-effectiveness of intervention research and development.

Scripts provided within this GitHub aim to provide information and processing assistance in areas including:
- Creating 2D and 3D reconstructions of benthic communuties from DSLR and GoPro imagery (Agisoft Metashape)
- Calculating 3D structural complexity metrics from 3D benthic models
